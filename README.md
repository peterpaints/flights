Ticket booking and flights reservation micro api.

#### Development

To begin, simply clone this repo, and run:
```
docker-compose up
```
That's it!

If you want to seed yourself as an admin user, to hit some of the endpoints
restricted for admins, then run:
```
docker-compose run flights python api/models/seed.py --email bla@bla.com --password Password1 --admin True
```

#### Info
This is a test micro-app, written in Flask, and wrapped in Docker. Flask is light-weight, and affords one more control over how to design database models, configure security for the API endpoints and serialize responses back to clients

#### The Endpoints

You can play around with the API by:
* Pasting [this url](http://35.234.209.220:8000/api/) in your browser, and working with the beautifully autogenerated Swagger UI
* Using [`Postman`](https://www.getpostman.com/)
* Using [`Curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/)

Here are SOME of the endpoints:

| URL Endpoint | HTTP Methods | Action |

| `api/healthz` | `GET`  | Check if the API is ready to receive requests|
| `api/users/register/` | `POST`  | Register a new user|
